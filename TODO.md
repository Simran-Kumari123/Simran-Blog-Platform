# Image Display Fix - TODO List

## Steps to Fix Image Display Issue:

1. [x] Fix CreatePost.jsx - Pass image to addPost function
2. [x] Fix App.jsx - Update addPost to preserve image data (convert File to base64)
3. [x] Fix Post.jsx - Handle both File objects and string paths for images (add base64 support)
4. [x] Create utility function for File to base64 conversion
5. [ ] Test the changes
6. [ ] Push code to GitHub

## Current Status: Testing in progress

## Implementation Details:
- File objects cannot be stored in localStorage, so we need to convert them to base64 strings
- Base64 strings can be stored and retrieved from localStorage
- Post component needs to handle base64 image strings in addition to File objects and file paths
- Created src/utils/imageUtils.js with utility functions:
  - fileToBase64(): Converts File objects to base64 strings
  - isBase64Image(): Checks if a string is a base64 encoded image
  - getImageSource(): Returns appropriate image source based on data type
